# Prerequisites:

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

* Jupyter Notebook: This project uses Jupyter Notebooks for an interactive coding experience. You can run Jupyter Notebook in a web browser or through an IDE that supports it.

* Python 3.x: The project is developed with Python 3. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. The exact minor version (e.g., 3.8 or 3.9) may depend on specific features used in the project.

* Visual Studio Code (Optional): The project can be run using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) with the Jupyter extension for an integrated development environment. However, this is optional, and Jupyter Notebook can be used independently of VSCode.

* Anaconda (Optional): Anaconda is a convenient way to install Python and Jupyter Notebook, along with other data science tools. It's optional but recommended for users who prefer an easy setup.
